## For this project, I used a digital media store database called Chinook.
## Below is the analysis of that database.

## 1. Show customers (full name, customer id, country) who are not in the US.

SELECT FirstName
, LastName
, CustomerId
,Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'
ORDER BY Country; 

## 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

## 3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
## The resulting table should show the customers full name, invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.InvoiceId
, inv.InvoiceDate
, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

## 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

## 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billings countries from the invoice table.

SELECT distinct(BillingCountry)
FROM chinook.invoices;

## 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each Sales Agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agents full name.

SELECT inv.InvoiceId
, emp.FirstName
, emp.LastName
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

## 7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer Name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.FirstName
, emp.LastName
, inv.Total
, cust.FirstName
, cust.LastName
, cust.Country
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

## 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

## 9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

## 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT track.Name
, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks track
ON inv.TrackId = track.TrackId;

## 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT art.Name as Artist
, trk.Name as Track
, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks trk
ON trk.TrackId = inv.TrackId

INNER JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON alb.AlbumId = trk.AlbumId

LEFT JOIN chinook.artists art
ON art.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId;

## 12.Provide a query tht shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT track.Name AS 'Track'
, alb.Title AS 'Album Title'
, med.Name AS 'Media Type'
, genre.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks track
JOIN chinook.albums alb
ON alb.AlbumId = track.AlbumId

JOIN chinook.media_types med
ON med.MediaTypeId = track.MediaTypeId

JOIN chinook.genres genre
ON genre.GenreId = track.GenreId;

## 13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT emp.FirstName
, emp.LastName
, ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total),2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

## 14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName
, emp. LastName
, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(inv.Total),2)) DESC LIMIT 5;
